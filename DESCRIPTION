Description: R package to fit growth models to data on size at age. Supports
    multiple model types, including standard growth-curve fitting, growth
    curves that differ among blocks in a data set (e.g. different growth curves
    for each species in a data set), and hierarchical models of growth curves
    where curve parameters depend on a predictor variable (e.g. a species's
    traits). Includes methods for model validation, comparison, and plotting.
